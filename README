This progam is a simulation of a new economic geography model. It reproduces Fujita-Krugman-Venables 1999 66-67p. simulations (three graphs) . It uses newton method to solve the equations system.

Program flags w1, w2, T, lambda, sigma, mu, iteration limit. You can change in the code to solve only the equation system for one lambda or all lambda.
